VAMPS rendition using Node.js (javascript)
=========
Visualization and Analysis of Microbial Population Structures
-----------------

To run this program first install Node.js (http://nodejs.org/)
look in package.json to see required modules or run
 * (sudo) npm -g install

To update modules:
  * npm update

To refresh anew via git
  * git fetch --all
  * git reset --hard origin/master

If this error occurs it is likely
the server is already running
  * events.js:72
    * throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event

--- START ---

Start this project:
  * npm start

Install nodemon to keep from restarting server after changes
  * sudo npm install nodemon -g
Then run as: 
  * nodemon bin/www

--- TESTS ---

Test using mocha
  * make test
  OR
  * mocha

To check code quality:
  * plato -r -x public/javascripts/jquery-2.1.1.min.js -d reports public app.js views routes models config sbin

Then see file vamps-node.js/reports/index.html in a browser.

--- DB ---

MySQL db schema is included in root dir as: db_schema.sql

Applying new database schema from vamps2 (on vampsdev)
  I will record all alterations to the database here:

--- Dir structure ---
routes - server side logic
views - html/ejs
models - data retrieval (db for now, hdf5 in the future) 
public - client side, cached with an expiration time
sbin - additional scripts


--- TODO ---
  * Testing!
  * Refactoring!
  * DONE:   projects/:id via REST
  * DONE:   user login and auth
  * add 960.gs grid to pages
