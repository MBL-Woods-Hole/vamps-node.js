Definition,"Unique for each sample in study, should be informative/descriptive  of sample - A sample at time point 1 (09/09/2014) depth 3m could be NA.t1.D3.09092014","Can be the same as sample name, or name of sample tube.  For human-associated samples it is de-identifying","A description of the sample that can include site, subject, sample matter",Refers to the number assigned to the specific metagenome being sampled:,Name of the TAXON_ID e.g. 408172 is marine metagenome,Of the study,Height above ground or sea in the air (in meters),"Is the latitude, longitude and elevation assigned from a geographic reference? y or n","The day and time of sampling, single point in time using a 24 hour time format","The time of sampling, single point in time using a 24 hour time format",Depth undergraound for soil or under water for aquatic samples.  Should be in meters,The geographical origin of the sample as defined by the country,Height of land above sea level in meters,Classification of the location where the sample was obtained,Classification of a specific feature in the biome,Classification of the material being sampled,Classification of the site by latitude and longitude in decimal degrees,Classification of the site by latitude and longitude in decimal degrees,temperature of the sample at time of sampling in degrees C,salinity measurement,diss_oxygen concentration,Has the sample been published?,You can choose to add a field for everything you think may be required for analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
