Notes compiled by Greg Caporaso


The data in this directory was constructed using the nested_gg_workflow.py
script in the QiimeUtils repository. This is open source code, but controlled
access as a lot of it is in development status. Contact Greg Caporaso
(gregcaporaso@gmail.com) for access to that code. If there is demand for the
scripts I will remove the controlled access by porting them into the main
QIIME repository.

All input files were downloaded on 4 Feb 2011. A log of this run can be found
as log_20110204200108.txt.
